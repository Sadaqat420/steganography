# Steganography

This repository contains batch scripts for hiding text files inside images using steganography. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

## Usage

1. Save the batch script (`steganography.bat`) in the same directory as the image and text file you want to use.
2. Run the batch script.
3. Enter the image file name (with extension) when prompted.
4. Enter the text file name (with extension) when prompted.
5. The script will create a new image file with the hidden text.

## Features

### Hide Text Inside Images:
Embed text files securely within image files, making the text content invisible to the naked eye.
### Simple Usage:
Easy-to-use batch scripts prompt users to input the image file and text file they wish to conceal, automating the process of embedding the text within the image.
### Responsible Usage:
Users are encouraged to utilize the tool responsibly and adhere to privacy laws and ethical guidelines when concealing information within images.
